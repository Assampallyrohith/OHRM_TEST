/*	Arrays

	Variables are capable of storing only one value, if we want to store multiple values under one variable name we can use arrays.

	An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

	Single Dimensional Array

	Syntax:

	dataType   arrayName[] = new dataType[size];

	The Size of the Array  should be declared and it is fixed

	Array can save only similar dataType Values

	Index of an array always starts with 0(zero).

	If the size of an array created and if we are not assigning any value into an index of an Array then it will store 0/null value

	Once the size of an array is created and if we try to insert an extra value into the array - it will not accept more than the size declared

	 

	Multi Dimensional Array

	Synatx:

	dataType arrayName[][] = new dataType[size][size];

	Object Array :

	Is capable of saving any dataType values

	Object arrayName[] = new Object[size]; // the size of the array should be declared

	Object arrayName[] [] = new Object[size][size];

	For Each Loop

	This loop can be used very well with iteration over arrays and other such collections.

	Syntax for this loop:

	for(dataType index: arrayName)

	{

	      //Statement / Statements

	}

	Variables are capable of storing only one value, if we want to store multiple values under one variable name we can use arrays.

	An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

	Note:- The disadvantage of arrays is their size is fixed and they can store values of only one datatype.

	 

	1. Single Dimensional Array

	2. Multi Dimensional Array

	3. Object Array

	 

	Array List:-

	This is a dynamic data structure which is capable of expanding or contracting based on the amount of data inserted, it can also store values of different datatypes.

	                   List<Object> arrayListName=new ArrayList<>();

	Note:- List<datatype> accepts only specified data type

	          Ex: List<String>:- Accepts only string data

	List:- accepts any datatype if declared of type Object

	 

	 

	 

	 

	ArrayList:

	Its a dynamic data structure. It is capable of saving any dataType values and need not be declared with size of the arrayList.

	List<dataType>arrayListName = new ArrayList<>();
